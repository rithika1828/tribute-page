        <section class="about_section">
            <p>She was born into a Brahman family near the southern Indian city of Mysore (now in Karnataka state). Her father died when she was young, and her mother, a film actress, moved the family first to Bangalore (Bengaluru) and then to Madras (now Chennai). Her family’s poor financial conditions forced her to quit her studies after completing secondary school. Although she had acted in a film while still in school, she now pursued that vocation full-time, becoming a highly successful star and acting in some 130 films between 1964 and 1980. Her success in the movie industry was in large part the result of her association with the iconic Tamil-language actor Maruthur Gopala Ramachandran (popularly known as MGR), with whom she made more than two dozen movies. MGR was also a politician, who founded the <u><b>AIADMK</b></u> in <u><b>1972 and from 1977 to 1987</b></u> was the chief minister of Tamil Nadu.</p>
            <br>
           <p> It is unclear to what extent MGR may have mentored Jayalalitha politically, but she joined the AIADMK in 1982 and quickly rose through the party ranks. In 1983 she was made the propaganda secretary of the party, and a year later she won a seat in the Rajya Sabha <u><b>(upper chamber of the Indian parliament)</b></u>. Following the death of MGR in late 1987, the AIADMK underwent a split, with MGR’s wife, Janaki Ramachandran, and Jayalalitha each heading competing factions of the party. The rift was healed in a few years, however, after the two groups had merged back together and Janaki Ramachandran had left politics. Jayalalitha became the leader of the party.
